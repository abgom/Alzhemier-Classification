# Alzhemier-Classification

This project is a part of my personal portafolio. 

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to create a model capable of identifying Alzheimer patients from brain data. The main goal is to train a model with high sensitivity to be sure that most of the patients with Alzheimer receive the correct diagnosis. 


### Methods Used
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Machine Learning
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Data Visualization
* Linear Algebra
* Grid Search
* Data Normalization

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Matplotlib, seaborn
* Pandas, numpy
* Grid Search
* ROC Curve, Confussion matrix

## Project Description
Using the volume data from 84 brain areas, I trained a SVM model to classify adults whether they had or they had not Alzheimer disease. To reduce the number of variables, I used PCA and I ended with 14 main components. From this data, I trained a model that maximized sensitivity and I ended with a model with 90% sensitivity.
